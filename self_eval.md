# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- Not part of the assignment, but I do have a question from today. Are arrays stored in variables, or is an array a type of variable (one that contains multiple elements)?
